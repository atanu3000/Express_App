## Installation

- `Install Node.js:` Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. To install Node.js, you can visit the official website at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en) and download the installer for your operating system. Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version, as it provides stability and compatibility.
- `Verify Node.js Installation:` After the installation is complete, open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command to verify that Node.js is installed correctly:
  ```bash
  node -v
  ```
  This command should print the version number of Node.js.
- `Initialize a New Node.js Project:` Once Node.js is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project in the command prompt or terminal. Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:
  ```bash
  npm init -y
  ```
  This command will prompt you to provide some information about your project and create a package.json file that will store the project's metadata and dependencies.
- `Install Express.js:` Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. To install Express.js, run the following command in the command prompt or terminal:
  ```bash
  npm install express
  ```
  This command will download and install the Express.js module and its dependencies in your project.
- `Create an Express.js Application:` After installing Express.js, you can create a new file, such as app.js or index.js, in your project directory and open it in a text editor. Then, add the following code to set up a basic Express.js application:
  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  
  const port = 3000; // Change this to the desired port number
  
  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
  });
  
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
  });
  ```
  This code creates an Express.js application, sets up a basic route that responds with "Hello, World!" when the root URL is accessed, and starts the server on the   specified port.

- `Start the Express.js Application:` Save the changes to the file, and in the command prompt or terminal, navigate to the project directory containing the app.js (or index.js) file. Run the following command to start the Express.js application:
  ```bash
  node app.js
  ```
  You should see a message indicating that the server is running on the specified port.
  
- `Access the Application:` Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified). You should see the "Hello, World!" message displayed in the browser, indicating that the Express.js application is running successfully.

## Usage

- `Clone this repository in your directory:` To clone this repository open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to keep the  Express.js application. Run the following command.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/atanu3000/Express_App.git
  ```
- `Install Dependencies:` In the same terminal run the following command to download required dependencies.
  
  ```bash
  npm i
  ```
  This command will read the `package.json` file of the application and install all the required dependencies.
- `Start the Express.js Application:` Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Express.js application. Run the following command:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- `Access the Application:` Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the appropriate port specified by the prebuilt application). This is the default URL where the Express.js application will be running on your localhost.

## Features

- `Using Node.js and Express.js offers the following key features:` Efficient server-side JavaScript execution, event-driven architecture, non-blocking I/O operations, seamless integration with databases, robust routing and middleware system, easy API development, support for real-time applications, and a vast ecosystem of modules and packages for rapid development.
